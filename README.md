## Summary

A pure JavaScript CORS alternative. No server configuration required - 
just add a `proxy.html` on the domain you wish to communicate with. This
library utilizes [XHook](http://jpillora.com/xhook) to hook all XHR, so XDomain should work in
conjunction with any library.

## Features

* Simple
* Library Agnostic
  * Tested with jQuery `$.ajax` (and subsequently `$.get`, `$.post`)
  * Tested with Angular `$http` service
* Cross domain XHR just magically works
  * No need to modify the server code
  * No need to use IE's silly [XDomainRequest Object](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/cc288060.aspx)
* White-list allowed domains
* White-list paths using regular expressions (e.g. only allow API calls: `/^\/api/`)

## Download

* Development [xdomain.js](http://xdomain.jpillora.com/dist/xdomain.js) 15.4KB
* Production [xdomain.min.js](http://xdomain.jpillora.com/dist/xdomain..minjs) 7.2KB (1.7KB Gzip)

  *Note: It's **important** to include XDomain first as other libraries may
    store a reference to `XMLHttpRequest` before XHook can patch it*

## Live Demos

### http://xdomain.jpillora.com/

## Browser Support

All except IE6/7 as they don't have `postMessage`

## Quick Usage

1. On your slave domain (`http://xyz.example.com`), create a small `proxy.html` file:
  
    ``` html
    <script src="http://xdomain.jpillora.com/dist/xdomain.js" master="http://abc.example.com"></script>
    ```

2. Then on your master domain (`http://abc.example.com`), pointing to a `proxy.html`:

    ``` html
    <script src="http://xdomain.jpillora.com/dist/xdomain.js" slave="http://xyz.example.com/proxy.html"></script>
    ```

3. Now any XHR to `http://xyz.example.com` will automagically work: 

    ``` js
    //do some vanilla XHR
    var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xhr.open('GET', 'http://xyz.example.com/secret/file.txt');
    xhr.onreadystatechange = function(e) {
      if(xhr.readyState === 4)
        alert(xhr.responseText);
    }
    xhr.send();

    //or if we are using jQuery...
    $.get('http://xyz.example.com/secret/file.txt').done(function(data) {
        console.log("got result: ", data);
    });
    ```

## More Examples

### Using multiple masters and slaves

The following two snippets are equivalent:

``` html
<script src="http://xdomain.jpillora.com/dist/xdomain.js" master="http://abc.example.com"></script>
```
``` html
<script src="http://xdomain.jpillora.com/dist/xdomain.js"></script>
<script>
xdomain({
  masters: {
  	'http://abc.example.com': /.*/
  }
});
</script>
```

With this in mind, we can then add more `masters` or (`slaves`) by simply including them
in the `object`, see API below.

## API

### `xdomain`(`object`)

If object contains:

### `slaves`

Then `xdomain` will load as a master

Each slave must be defined as: `slave domain` -> `path to proxy file` 

### `masters`

Then `xdomain` will load as a slave

Each master must be defined as: `master domain` -> `regex matching allowed paths` 

You can allow all with: `'*': /.*/` though this is not recommended.

## Conceptual Overview

1. XDomain will create an iframe on the master to the slave's proxy.
2. Master will communicate to slave iframe using postMessage.
3. Slave will create XHRs on behalf of master then return the results.

## Internet Explorer

If you've set your page to use quirks mode for some reason. You won't
have `JSON` on the page, and XDomain will warn you. Easiest solution is
just to use the HTML5 DOCTYPE `<!DOCTYPE HTML>`
