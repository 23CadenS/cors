## Summary

A pure JavaScript CORS alternative. No server configuration required - 
just add a `proxy.html` on the domain you wish to communicate with. This
library utilizes [XHook](http://jpillora.com/xhook) to hook all XHR, so XDomain should work in
conjunction with any library.

## Features

* Simple
* Cross domain `XMLHttpRequest` will work magically
  * Tested with jQuery `$.ajax` (and subsequently `$.get`, `$.post`)
  * Tested with Angular `$http` service
* White-list allowed domains
* White-list paths using regular expressions (e.g. only allow API calls: `/^\/api/`)

## Download

* Development [xdomain.js](http://xdomain.jpillora.com/dist/xdomain.js) X KB
* Production [xdomain.min.js](http://xdomain.jpillora.com/dist/xdomain..minjs) XKB (XKB Gzip)

* Note: It's **important** to include XDomain first as other libraries may
  store a reference to `XMLHttpRequest` before XHook can patch it*

## Browser Support

* All except IE6/7 as they don't have `postMessage`

## Usage

On your slave domain (`http://xyz.example.com`), create a `proxy.html` file which looks like:
  
``` html
<script src="http://xdomain.jpillora.com/dist/xdomain.js" masters="http://abc.example.com"></script>
```

Which is actually shorthand for:

``` html
<html>
<body>
  <!-- XDomain -->
  <script src="http://xdomain.jpillora.com/dist/xdomain.js"></script>
  <!-- XDomain Whitelist - { Domain: Allow Path RegExp } -->
  <script>
  $.xdomain({
    masters: {
      'http://abc.example.com': /.*/
    }
  });
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

Then on your master domain (`http://abc.example.com`), define all slaves:

``` javascript
//add the slave and the path to its proxy
$.xdomain({
  slaves: {
    'http://xyz.example.com': '/proxy.html'
  }
});

//... then after, if we are using jQuery ...

//all requests to 'xyz.example.com' will magically work
$.get('http://xyz.example.com/secret/data.json').done(function(data) {
    console.log("got result: ", data);
});

//$.ajax(...)

//$.post(...)

```

Demo

API
---

## `xdomain`(`object`)

If object contains:

### `slaves`

Then `xdomain` will load as a master

Each slave must be defined as: `slave domain` -> `path to proxy file` 

### `masters`

Then `xdomain` will load as a slave

Each master must be defined as: `master domain` -> `regex matching allowed paths` 

You can allow all with: `'*': /.*/` though this is not recommended.

## Conceptual Overview

1. XDomain will create an iframe on the master to the slave's proxy.
2. Master will communicate to slave iframe using postMessage.
3. Slave will create XHRs on behalf of master then return the results.

## Contributing

Issues and Pull-requests welcome.

## Change Log

v0.3.0 - Moved to vanilla, using XHook to hook XHR instead of `$.ajax`
