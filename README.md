## Summary

A pure JavaScript CORS alternative. No server configuration required - 
just add a `proxy.html` on the domain you wish to communicate with. This
library utilizes [XHook](http://jpillora.com/xhook) to hook all XHR, so XDomain should work in
conjunction with any library.

## Features

* Simple
* Library Agnostic
  * Tested with jQuery `$.ajax` (and subsequently `$.get`, `$.post`)
  * Tested with Angular `$http` service
* Cross domain XHR just magically works
  * No need to modify the server code
  * No need to use IE's silly [XDomainRequest Object](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/cc288060.aspx)
* Easy XHR access to file servers:
  * [Amazon](http://jpillora.com/xdomain)
  * Dropbox
* Includes [XHook](http://jpillora.com/xhook)
* White-list allowed domains
* White-list paths using regular expressions (e.g. only allow API calls: `/^\/api/`)

## Download

* Development [xdomain.js](http://jpillora.com/xdomain/dist/xdomain.js) 16KB
* Production [xdomain.min.js](http://jpillora.com/xdomain/dist/xdomain..minjs) 7.5KB (1.8KB Gzip)

    Note: It's **important** to include XDomain first as other libraries may
    store a reference to `XMLHttpRequest` before XHook can patch it

## Live Demo

### http://jpillora.com/xdomain

## Browser Support

All except IE6/7 as they don't have `postMessage`

## Quick Usage

1. On your slave domain (`http://xyz.example.com`), create a small `proxy.html` file:
  
    ``` html
    <script src="http://jpillora.com/xdomain/dist/xdomain.js" master="http://abc.example.com"></script>
    ```

2. Then on your master domain (`http://abc.example.com`), point to your new `proxy.html`:

    ``` html
    <script src="http://jpillora.com/xdomain/dist/xdomain.js" slave="http://xyz.example.com/proxy.html"></script>
    ```

3. Done! Now, any XHR to `http://xyz.example.com` will automagically work: 

    ``` js
    //do some vanilla XHR
    var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xhr.open('GET', 'http://xyz.example.com/secret/file.txt');
    xhr.onreadystatechange = function(e) {
      if(xhr.readyState === 4)
        alert(xhr.responseText);
    }
    xhr.send();

    //or if we are using jQuery...
    $.get('http://xyz.example.com/secret/file.txt').done(function(data) {
        console.log("got result: ", data);
    });
    ```

## More Examples

### Using multiple masters and slaves

The following two snippets are equivalent:

``` html
<script src="http://jpillora.com/xdomain/dist/xdomain.js" master="http://abc.example.com"></script>
```
``` html
<script src="http://jpillora.com/xdomain/dist/xdomain.js"></script>
<script>
xdomain({
  masters: {
  	'http://abc.example.com': /.*/
  }
});
</script>
```

With this in mind, we can then add more `masters` or (`slaves`) by simply including them
in the `object`, see API below.

## API

### `xdomain`(`object`)

If object contains:

* ### `slaves`

  Then `xdomain` will load as a master
  
  Each slave must be defined as: `origin` -> `proxy file`
  
  An object is used to *list* slaves to reinforce the idea
  that there is 1 proxy file per origin.

* ### `masters`

  Then `xdomain` will load as a slave
  
  Each master must be defined as: `origin` -> `allowed path` (RegExp) 
  
  `origin` will also be converted to a regular expression by escaping all
  non alphanumeric chars and converting '*' into `.+`.
  
  Requests that do not match **both** the `origin` and the `path` regular
  expressions will be blocked.

  So you could use the following `proxy.html` to allow all subdomains of `example.com`:
  
  ```html
  <script src="/dist/xdomain.js" master="http://*.example.com"></script>
  ```
  
  Which is equivalent to:
  ```html
  <script src="/dist/xdomain.js"></script>
  <script>
    xdomain({
      masters: {
        "http://*.example.com": /.*/
      }
    });
  </script>
  ```
  
  Therefore, you could allow domains with the following `proxy.html`:
  ```html
  <script src="/dist/xdomain.js" master="*"></script>
  ```
  
  Though this is NOT recommended.

## Conceptual Overview

1. XDomain will create an iframe on the master to the slave's proxy.
2. Master will communicate to slave iframe using postMessage.
3. Slave will create XHRs on behalf of master then return the results.

## Internet Explorer

If you've set your page to use quirks mode for some reason. The
`JSON` global object won't exist and XDomain will warn you and exit. Easiest solution is
just to use the HTML5 DOCTYPE `<!DOCTYPE HTML>`

## FAQ

Q: But I love CORS

A: You shouldn't:

* IE uses a different API (XDomainRequest) for CORS, XDomain normalizes this silliness.
* On RESTful JSON API server, CORS will send a preflight OPTIONS request on every request except GET,
  generating supurfluous traffic.
* Not everyone can change the HTTP headers on the server, but most people can drop in a `proxy.html` file
* Google also uses iframes as postMessage proxies instead of CORS in it's Google API JS SDK:

  ```html
  <iframe name="oauth2relay564752183" id="oauth2relay564752183"
  src="https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/postmessageRelay?..."> </iframe>
  ```
